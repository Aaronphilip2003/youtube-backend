hi I'm James the bald engineer both of
these are transistors one is a BJT and
the other is a MOSFET can you tell the
difference if not that's okay because in
this Adams video we're going to take a
look at MOSFETs how they work and how
you can use them in your circuits so
let's get going
this video is part of a two part series
on transistors the previous one covered
bipolar Junction transistors bjts while
this video covers
metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect
transistors known as MOSFETs generally
you'll use a BJT
for small loads say less than one amp of
current while MOSFETs are well suited
for applications with much higher
current for the video on bjts see Adams
comm / EP 10 for now let's move on to
MOSFETs
mas is a flourless plant that typically
grows one to ten centimetres some mosses
grow up to 50 centimetres and can be
commonly found on trees wait a minute
this is the wrong script hold on
the tree sounds right okay here's the
other stuff okay let's try this again
MOSFETs belong to a family tree of field
effect transistors or known as FETs
there are J FETs MOSFETs and igbts J
feds actually work a little bit like a
BJT which we've already talked about for
this video we're focused on the MOSFET
which has two types of modes called
depletion and enhancement
a depletion mode MOSFET works like a
normally closed switch current can flow
when no voltage is applied
applying a negative voltage actually
causes the current flow to stop an
enhancement mode fit works like a
variable resistor they come in in
channel and P channel types
enhancement mode fits are by far the
most common transistor used today so
let's focus in on them
here's the symbol for an n-channel
enhancement mode MOSFET and here's a
to-220 style transistor the pins of a
MOSFET are identified as the gate the
drain and the source the field effect
part of their name suggests they work by
voltage compared to a BJT which works by
current
when voltage is applied between the gate
and the source
current is allowed to flow between the
drain and the source
here's the really cool thing about
MOSFETs they're variable resistors
controlled by voltage which means
depending on the voltage applied between
the gain source the resistance between
the drain and source will vary
with a low voltage at the gate the
resistance from the drain to source is
very high it's kind of like an open
switch
as we increase the voltage at the gate
we pass a threshold voltage and then the
resistance from the drain to the source
drops and it drops very quickly the key
difference between a MOSFET and a BJT is
that the output current isn't a
multiplier of the input because MOSFETs
are all about voltage
since the resistance is between the
drain and source it is known as RDS on
and can always be found in the MOSFETs
datasheet for example this is a fq p 3 0
n 0 6 l let's take a look at its data
sheet from fairchild we can see that RDS
is given when there are two different
voltages from gate to source at 10 volts
the on resistance will be about 27
millions and while at 5 volts the on
resistance is only about 35 milli ohms
that's pretty small when you think about
it
we picked this MOSFET on purpose it is
known as a logic level MOSFET because
the voltage from gate to source vgs is
lower than 5 volts in other words the
threshold to turn the MOSFET on is low
enough to be used by an Arduino or
Raspberry Pi not all MOSFETs are logic
level compatible so it is very important
to check to see what the vgs threshold
is before using it in your circuit since
you will probably use a MOSFET
in high current applications it is
important to check how hot it is going
to get here's how we calculate if we
need a heatsink or not
the formula to determine how much power
the MOSFET dissipates is resistance
times current squared
in this case the resistance is RDS on
and the current is whatever your load
will draw let's use an example of a
motor that draws one amp of current
this means we multiply 35 millions by
one amp squared to get 35 milli watts
okay now we need a few more things from
the datasheet
first we need the Junction to ambient
coefficient which is our theta J a and
in this case is sixty two point five
degrees C per watt we also need the
maximum Junction temperature which in
this case is 175 degrees C
using this formula we can calculate the
maximum power the transistor can
dissipate without using a heatsink
we take the maximum junction temperature
- the ambient temperature which is going
to be 25 degrees C and divided by the
thermal resistance this gives a maximum
dissipation of 2.4 watts in our example
we are only dissipating 35 milli watts
so we're safe to operate without a heat
sink
now you might be wondering how can the
number we calculate be 2.4 Watts when
the datasheet clearly said in
seventy-nine watts and that's a really
great point
the 79 watts is if we had the ability to
cool the transistors case to 25 degrees
C which means you have to be using some
kind of heatsink but we're going to
cover more on that in a later video
let's review what you need to know to
use a MOSFET as a switch number one find
out which pin is the gate drain and
source number two look at the data sheet
to determine the threshold voltage which
is going to be shown as vgs or v th
buying the drain to source resistance or
RDS on number 4 look at R theta J a and
the maximum Junction temperature to
calculate how hot the MOSFET will get
