maybe this is mandelbrot set back to
basics
um i need your help though can you think
of a number um
seven good can you square that number
49.
can you do this while filming you've
done it correctly so far okay next
question you're gonna get upset square
49
no okay good answer
the thing is i don't really care about
the answer what i'm caring about is an
iteration i can keep asking you to do
the same thing again and again and if i
ask you to pick a number and keep
squaring it you already know what's
going to happen right
it's gonna get big it's gonna blow up is
it
square one
okay except one okay good now square
half
okay it's gonna get smaller yeah so
sometimes it blows up and actually that
happens when it's bigger than one and it
becomes quite obvious when you try it
but one doesn't blow up so one's
different and numbers less than one like
a half
actually become a quarter when you
square them and that becomes a sixteenth
and so on but then numbers much less
than one like minus six
and that one's blown up as well so what
i'm really talking about and what
iteration is quite often talking about
is when the iterations are stable
when they sort of head towards somewhere
you can see
and when they're not and it's best to
see this on a diagram so have a look at
my screen here you pick the number seven
which is kind of off my screen here but
these red arrows would i'm moving them
around
this is not the greatest diagram let me
get this clearance to start with it's
just a line but the arrows are heading
that way because when i square this
number i'm moving around they go that
way and they never come back much like
your seven did but if i go less than
this number one they don't go that way
anymore they go that way
in fact they head towards zero and
they're stable there so for the sake of
moving it around it's kind of nice to
see the difference is a really sharp
line and it completely changes behavior
but that way they're unstable that way
they're stable stable unstable stable
unstable stable stable understandable
you get the idea in fact if you go
negative
they're still stable they head positive
because when you square a number that's
negative they get positive still head
towards zero until you hit minus one and
then
unstable stable stable unstable stable
now despite all my commentary it's not
that exciting
yet
and if you know anything about the
theory of uh iterations and the
consequences of them or if you've
watched any other video about the
mandelbrot set you know that
we're not just talking about real
numbers are the numbers on the line i've
just been showing you we're talking
about numbers in two dimensions so
complex numbers and i'm not going to
give you an introduction to complex
numbers here because i don't think you
need to hear it and there are other
places you can get them
holly on the number five channel has
done excellent videos about how this
happens but i want to show you the same
comments that she's made on brown paper
i'd like to show you
moving here's my two-dimensional number
line
here is the number that you get to pick
randomly we can still do it in one
dimension just by sliding along here and
the other dot that's moving around this
tiny one
is the square of the other dot
so one squared is about one bigger than
one it heads off that way lower than one
goes that way but i can move off the
line now and it has a weirdly circular
flavor to it which i kind of like it's
like chasing the number around it moves
quicker than you expect and that's
already quite pleasing if you're a nerd
like me but what i really interested is
the iteration if you keep doing the
instruction square it square it square
it we saw what happened on the real line
in two dimensions it looks different so
it looks like this
so this line indicates if you start
there it goes to there when you square
it and then to there and there and so if
i move this around the picture is kind
of pleasing
kind of wobbles around but it's always
heading towards the center
which i'll say is stable
and there's a reason there's a circle on
the screen because
anytime i'm inside this circle it looks
like it's stable even if it's kind of
pretty as it moves
but if i go near the edge of the circle
it's less obviously stable it takes a
lot longer to get to the center and then
if i go outside the circle
unstable
stable unstable stable stable unstable
stable this is a really nice
demonstration of why complex numbers are
helpful in that instead of your entire
image of what's happening being on a
line
you've got a picture but it gets better
right
instead of just squaring it
what would happen if you did square it
add something square it add something
square it add something now we could go
back to the real line and see it
happening on just one dimension but
i feel like we should just go straight
into two dimensions this is just the
square square and square root square
this letter c is indicating a number i
could add every time so let me just
slide it away from zero the moment it's
not adding anything but if i add this
number this red number which is a
complex number as two-dimensional you
can see something very different has
happened
if i start with this number and i keep
squaring it and adding that number
square it add that number square it add
that number square add that number this
is the path it goes and it makes a
lovely star shape
what's interesting though is not just
the star shape although i kind of like
it it's the stability so all around here
is stable and it always gives you the
same sort of stability like the starry
stability even if it's expanding or
shrinking
but you kind of get the feeling that
sometimes it's going to blow up and it's
not obvious where because if i go near
the circle you think it's going to blow
up it's going to blow
but it doesn't oh
there was a moment there so outside the
circle still stable but
somewhere else outside the circle
unstable
and in fact it's not obvious where this
is happening stable unstable stable
stable unstable no stable still but over
here inside the circle always stable
unless i go there i keep saying the
circle as if it's important it's really
not important anymore the boundary is
clearly not a circle but it's kind of
nice to move this around i think that
some places are unstable and some are
stable what i'd really like to see
and i hope you would too is the boundary
of stability
so let's see that in fact let's look at
the boundary if the number i choose to
add each time is zero you get the circle
that's like the simple iteration but if
you choose to add something different by
the way i'm gonna i'm gonna write
something down here what i'm capturing
is this iteration which always looks a
bit technical
uh and if i cover that bit up is what we
did at the beginning i said square a
number and that's your new number square
it square it square it but instead of
just squaring you do square it add
something they use c for it's a constant
but it's a complex number
now we're ready to look at that if c is
zero you get a circle if it's not zero
i see where my brain melts a little tiny
bit if c is not zero the shapes become
these shapes
and i always find this a little bit of a
shock
there may be some familiar looking
shapes i don't know but sometimes
they're not even connected together
they're like dusty little particles
and these regions particularly when
there's obviously a region which is not
a circle necessarily they're called
julius sets
and again holly's done a really lovely
video about julia setz
there's a bit of history about julia
sets um found by gaston julia hence the
name who was a guy french mathematician
i think early 20th century he did it
without a computer like he wasn't able
to just do this and move on jojoba and
see the boundary he was doing this
by hand and realizing there was some
beautiful structure
like i mean every time i tell the story
i'm like fair play
he also was really interesting in that
he had no nose
genuinely going to find a picture of
gaston julia he has a leather thing
across his face his nose was damaged in
i think the first world war before i
leave julia entirely the sets that you
can see give you a little bit of a hint
about what's coming so
let me show you two things about the
julia says first of all the simplest one
is a circle it's not that exciting
but they are exciting but they're not
always obvious regions sometimes they
look like they're separate regions these
don't look like they're connected
the way i'm animating it here they're
all slightly dusty looking that's just
the way i'm making it happen quickly but
sometimes they're definitely not joined
together and sometimes they look like
things you might recognize the outline
is looking vaguely like something i've
hinted about this video may be looking
like but there is something important
that holly mentions in some of her
videos about which ones are joined
together connected mathematically and
which ones are disconnected separate
like dust let me show you what they end
up describing so if we go back
to this diagram when i did the iteration
we were originally starting by you
picking a number and squaring it what
happened in 1979 is a guy called benoit
that was his first name it didn't get
better for him her name was mandelbrock
it's a very famous figure in mathematics
these days but it was 1979 1980 it's
kind of recent in the grand scale of
mathematics benoit was like
i wonder what happens if i always start
a zero instead of me saying pick a
number i would say like pick a number as
long as it's zero
and then all i really care about is
what's the constant i add each time and
which ones of those
give me stable and which ones don't
now he didn't have a good computer he
was doing it on an ibm working for ibm
at the time and having to print out on a
dot matrix or
probably even pre dot matrix printer
but we can kind of shortcut that so let
me show you what it looks like always
start at zero
and move the constant around each time
and if you do that all you'll see is
sometimes it's stable like this and
sometimes it's different stable i just
really love this i'm just going to move
it around
they're kind of
predictable and yet not predictable you
get spirally things you get spider web
things and sometimes it's not stable
it's unstable sometimes it's
got like how many arms is that seven
arms sometimes it's got three arms
sometimes it's got something else and
sometimes it's just rubbish this is just
the squaring adding squaring and adding
these what they call these are the
orbits
of
for every constant i pick which you
mentioned i picked one arbitrarily it
happened to be up in the top left there
this one in fact
that's its orbit
but any other constant you pick anywhere
on the screen has an orbit and some of
them are boring they're just
gone and some of them are not
they're stable and some of them are not
quite sure where the hell's going
excuse my english there the uh
the idea that maybe some points are
special and some are not is what benoit
mandelbrot first began to investigate
other people were investigating it but
it ended up with this idea getting his
name on it so let me simulate what he
first saw remember he didn't have a
monitor on his computer he had a printer
he's like type some code in if you want
a picture you print it like 10 minutes
later after you sold all the printer
problems which
still occur weird
he then has got to go and look what he's
like have i broken the printer or have i
messed my code up or is what i'm seeing
actually real and what he found was that
what he saw
the technicians got there first and they
were like well he's got it wrong again
and they cleaned up his images
and took all the sort of dust that they
assumed were printer artifacts they're
like there's this smudgy bit here
clearly not meant to be there we'll just
like chop that off or tell the printer
and he eventually had to go to the
technician and say like my prints keep
coming back different from what i
expected they're like we're just
cleaning them up he's like
stop cleaning them i think what i'm
trying to see is a weird messy dusty
looking thing and they're like oh you
want that
i don't know exactly what happened
there's a really good book by james
gleick called chaos which kind of tells
that story worth a read but i'm going to
simulate the dust that he saw i'm sorry
about the lack of brown paper but
there's a reason for the colour
this is the same orbit thing i was
showing you just now
can you see there's like a spirally
three there but i'm even a black trail
because i'm telling george bro to color
the screen black if it's stable
and if it's unstable like that one
it goes blue
black blue stable unstable and i'm just
going to scribble on the screen now this
is not going to make a good picture but
i want you kind of to feel what
mandelbrot felt like so he was seeing
black and blue dots or in this case
probably just white and black dots black
for stable and in my case blue for
unstable
and he started to wonder why there's a
black region here
that's not over there it's not
symmetrical i really think it must have
felt something like this when you have a
rubbish printer and you don't trust your
code and you wonder what the hell are
you seeing
so this is going to take ages right i'm
going to shortcut the process what he
eventually saw
in higher resolution than he saw is this
picture
and the black regions like i was
coloring earlier are stable you can see
anywhere i go in the black region
you get a nice stable pattern with
lovely orbits and that's the thing i
love seeing move but if i go over the
edge unstable
stable
unstable stable unstable so it's even
stable in this region it goes into like
two piles but if i go outside the region
disappeared if i go up here you get into
three piles and in fact holly's done a
lovely video on how many piles you start
making depending on which of these
little bulbs you go into
but the first time that mandelbrot saw
this he had no idea about any of that
structure he just saw a shape
which
shocked him first of all it's beautiful
it's kind of weird but getting a viewer
to display it like i've got on the
screen now
you can go and watch any number of
youtube videos and zoom in on it but you
can see what mandelbrock couldn't see
that he saw this little blob and thought
i wonder what that is and he had no idea
until he wrote his code better that it
was another version not quite the same
and you can just zoom in forever and now
i don't think youtube needs more videos
of me zooming in on the mandelbrot set
however i'm gonna do it anyway
ben why are there different colors like
it's not always black and blue
absolutely so the original mandelbrot
set that mandelbrot saw was two colors
stable unstable
black white or whatever i did black and
blue the colors you're seeing in this
are an arbitrary decision but they're
not as arbitrary as you might think so
let's go back to the original which is
out here black for stable but the colors
indicate that it's unstable
but the color indicates how unstable and
so if you think back to the very first
question i asked you i said square it
square it square it and within two
iterations you're like no
because it's big and that's an
indication that you don't need to ask
any more iterations to know what it's
going to do
with complex numbers it's less obvious
what it's going to do it's much harder
to predict but eventually we prove
mathematicians i say we
not me mathematicians prove that if you
go outside a circle
radius 2
it's never coming back
but if you're inside you can't guarantee
it it might be bouncing around near the
edge and it might stabilize again and
you see some of the orbits are
complicated so all you do with the
computer is you ask it to check let's
say 200 times
and if you're still inside
radius 2 circle of 200 you're like
let's color it black it's probably
stable
but after like 50 iterations if you've
just crossed outside well now i know
it's gone but maybe the next time you
check it takes 60 iterations
and well that's less unstable maybe i
could color that differently that was a
long way of saying the different colors
on the image are the different levels of
instability really is how many times you
checked before you knew they were going
to explode
and what matters when you zoom in is
that the colors change really really
quickly so all the colors on the screen
here indicating that a tiny movement of
the original point gives you massively
different behavior and that's become
what we call the sort of hallmark of
chaos theory now is where a tiny change
gives you fundamentally different
behavior on the mandelbrot set you move
your chain every point you make is
dependent on which c you pick but julia
said you fixed one and i can turn this
software into julia set mode
i'll do it slightly first if i press j
on here there's the circle which is the
original julia set
and that's in the middle here but if i
move the mouse around you see the julius
sets with different values of c
start changing beautifully like i mean
it's just a quick sketchy animation but
it's already much more nice than the
outlines you saw earlier
and what i love about this is the
mandelbrot set is kind of like a map of
julia sets so if you go and find
a bit of the mandelbrot set down here
this is called seahorse valley
because it kind of looks like you've got
loads of sea horses spiraling around
but if i switch to a julius set around
this point
it looks the same
but if i zoom out of the julia set
you don't degenerate into mandelbrot you
just get the seahorse julia set there it
is that's as big as you get so
if you zoom in on the mandelbrot set you
get little sort of like regions which
are like the julia set from that area
it's like a map it's a geography of
iterative stability
when you say like that it sounds
complicated but you just do something
again and again and find out what
happens in the long term
and the fact that it makes something so
beautiful i mean
it's it's become so cliche for
mathematicians to get excited about but
i still get excited about it because
it's lovely i didn't design it it's just
there we can explore it and we can just
sit and stare hypnotized at it for hours
and you can program it in 10 seconds on
a spreadsheet if you want to
so as you said it's not in the
mandelbrot set right
and what that means so let's call this
number say
well i've already used c but let's call
it c anyways
