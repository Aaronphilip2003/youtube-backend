thanks for stopping by this is two
minute classroom and today we're talking
about viscosity
i'll first give a general definition of
viscosity and then look at some examples
to make sure it's crystal clear
viscosity refers to a substance
resistance to flow
in essence how fluid it is a substance
with a low viscosity will have very
little resistance to flow
meaning it flows easily and quickly
while a substance with high viscosity
will strongly resist flow
meaning it flows very slowly let's look
at some examples
water has a low viscosity it flows
easily
spills out of a glass splashes in a pool
and runs down your face when you cry
other examples of low viscosity fluids
include oil
milk and blood honey has a high
viscosity because it has a high
resistance to flow
you have to squeeze the container to get
it out it globs up and has to be spread
around with a knife
it does not easily flow other examples
of high viscosity fluids include
molasses
glue and even peanut butter which has
such a high viscosity it acts like a
solid
it's also important to note that
viscosity varies with temperature
heating up honey in the microwave
decreases its viscosity
