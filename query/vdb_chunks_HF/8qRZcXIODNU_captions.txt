ruin
quite thank you one and all for

[Music]
oh great he's a freaking weirdo France
the most prosperous cultured and
beautiful nation in the world as it had
been for centuries an exquisite social
culture with the king in the upper
classes throwing crazy parties every
night enjoying high living and fine
dining who cares that they were only
able to do so off the backs of the
hard-working starving poor what are they
gonna do revolt there are only 80
percent of the population no life in
France is great
what's that France you want to go to war
with Britain and increase your power go
for it little buddy you do you and
you're lost now you're in severe
financial debt we have no money what do
we do should we stop partying heck no
party harder that's okay the peasantry
will pick up the slack they were created
by God to do all the work and you were
created to reap all the benefits and
party hard that's just how society works
and we've all just accepted it for
centuries
why Why What why did the nobility get to
be all rich and stuff just because they
were born into it and the rest of us
Schmucks just have to accept that help
why do we even need a king who decided
that it all just seems very unfair and
unequal and I for one am starting to
question wow that's very enlightened of
you and so began the Age of
Enlightenment the great philosophical
thinkers across France and Beyond began
to question whether this beautiful
nation was really all that beautiful
after all hey Prince Louie bad news your
grandpa died of smallpox this morning
which means good news you're now the
king so just to sum up friends is in
severe financial debt and the angry
populace are beginning to question how
necessary you are but hey I believe in
you champ you got this maybe
thou know'st Prince Louie kept pay
became King Louie the sixteenth in May
1774 he was a notoriously weak man and
he knew it he barely had the wisdom to
rule a nation never mind one in crisis
and he was easily manipulated by those
around him one of his first acts was to
try to get revenge on the British by
financing their American colonies
revolution Hey
we're an independent nation now that was
real swell of you Louie couldn't have
done it without you glad I could help
so hey about all that money we lent you
when can we get that back yeah you're a
great guy I'll never forget what you've
done for us real glad I could help
friend but about that money gotta go now
Chum best of luck to you
doubt war now ole and now France was in
even more debt
France is poor suffering under the
strain of economic ruin watched as a
nobility continued to live as though
nothing was wrong in particular they
grew increasingly disdainful of the
Queen Marie Antoinette as she continued
to spend all of France's money on her
own luxurious lifestyle and fashion
while the peasants were breaking their
backs in the fields she was walking
around like hey my hair is about I'm not
making that up her hair really was about
and her lavish spending earned her the
nickname madam deficit and speaking of
the Queen there was also a long-standing
scandal around the fact that the King
took a very long time to boink her and
the working classes of Paris began
ridiculing the royal couple with lewd
pamphlets depicting the Queen as a court
thought and the king is a wuss unable to
fulfill his marital duty respect for the
monarchy was at an all-time low as
Frances finances were spiraling out of
control and the king and his aides
really only had one solution to the
crisis tax the poor tax the poor we
could do a sexy calendar shoot
I mean
the poor and so it was the poor who were
already struggling to make ends meet
found themselves being taxed from every
direction hey I'm the Royal tax
collector looks like you've yet to pay
your income tax head tax by the way how
many windows you got in that house
here's three yep
there's gonna be a text for that hey
your local priest here have you paid
your church tithe yet well at least this
one is going to the good work of God or
God I think this year God wants me to
buy a new swimming pool hey private tax
collector here oh and I brought some
goons with me just a few quick questions
how much salt did you buy this year
about seven kilos I think yeah okay
there's gonna be a tax for that oh
what's that over there that's extra sold
I held over from last year so I wouldn't
have to buy as much this year oh yeah
and there's a tax for that and what are
you doing with all this salt
well obviously cooking mm-hmm on the
table yep and preserving fish and meat
Oh Oh No
yeah and there's a tax for that hey how
old is he he's nine and so he's
purchased his required amount of salt
for this year right what
no he's nine uh oh sorry little Timmy
looks like I'm gonna have to tax you for
that
yep salty there's gonna be a tax for
that and that's not all a huge portion
of the peasants harvest had to be given
up and there was also the labor tax
where peasants were required to work a
certain number of days for their local
Lord without pay obviously people
weren't too happy with these taxation
policies and the aggressive nature of
these private tax farmers sometimes even
escalated to violence in particular
though the people really hated how
inconsistent that taxation rules were
across the nation and also the fact that
the first two estates often had to pay
very little if any tax at all and so the
anger continued to grow France had a
population that was just about ready to
explode
what could push them over the edge how
about a touch of natural disaster a
series of harsh summers and winters left
the peasants harvests in Rouen meaning
they had no food or money and the cost
of bread skyrocketed of course the upper
classes had massive stocks of grain and
wheat so they were virtually untouched
by this new crisis but now the poor
really were starving and they began to
riot women took to the streets bakeries
were raided and bakers suspected of
keeping bread for themselves where
sometimes even hanged wow this is really
getting out of control
your majesty we need some decisive
action you need to step up and lead us
what will you do okay okay I've got this
I know I'll summon the estates-general
and they'll decide what to do
you really are a fat ill-bred boy the
estates-general is the closest thing
France had to a government apart from
the king it was a purely advisory body
and was rarely summoned in fact it
hadn't been summoned for a hundred and
seventy-five years prior to this but
with France in a severe crisis the king
felt the time is right to call on the
government to help the estates-general
was made up of representatives from the
three estates that is the clergy the
nobility and everybody else okay
thanks for coming everyone the first
order of business is regarding the
clergy and nobility you all get
brand-new Porsches you get a Porsche and
you get a Porsche and you get a Porsche
everybody gets a Porsche and now into
the second order of business France is
completely out of money like it's never
been this bad before
anyone got any ideas how about we all
get Lamborghinis next time the king
decided that in order to make a decision
they had to come up with a voting system
okay the clergy you have a population of
a hundred and thirty thousand so you'll
get one vote the nobility you have a
population of 350,000 so you'll also get
one vote and the Third Estate you have a
population of 27 million people and make
up 98% of the population very impressive
you'll get
one vote the Third Estate were obviously
pretty unhappy with this system because
they kept on finding that this would
happen we propose to raise taxes on the
Third Estate all in favor all opposed
two to one taxes will be raised on the
third estate we propose a motion that
says the first two estates are a bunch
of poo poo heads all in favor all
opposed
two to one it's official we are not poo
poo heads the Third Estate realised that
any attempt at reform would be add voted
by the two upper estates and they
thought that was kind of lame so they
decided that since they were 98% of the
population they could go off to form
their own government make their own laws
and take over the running of the country
and so the National Assembly was born
the Third Estate was now in control and
there was nothing the king could do to
stop haha I've locked you all out of
your building what are you gonna do
about it we'll probably go find a
different building that isn't locked
Wow no the National Assembly did find
another unlock building just down the
road an indoor tennis court we're on the
20th of June 1789 they all took the
tennis court oath pledging to continue
meeting until the king finally gave in
to their demands for more equality and
economic reform this new national
assembly included many of the most
educated members of the Third Estate
including two young lawyers by the names
of maximilien robespierre and Jorge
Denton some members of the first two
estates even joined their cause
some of these men formed a radical new
political party called the Jacobin Club
and quickly became leading figures while
many members of the Third Estate simply
wanted more equality a growing number in
this Jacobin faction would begin calling
for something even crazier the removal
of the king entirely and this is where
fear began to take hold with such a
volatile situation developing everyone
was afraid of something the king feared
his position was under threat and he
called in the military to take position
around Paris the Third Estate heard
rumor of the gathering military force
and they feared the king was planning to
round them up and arrest them maybe he'd
even execute them it also didn't help
that the King had justice miss Frances
popular finance minister who had been
trying to make reforms himself it seemed
the king was done negotiating fear left
unchecked often boils over into anger
and anger detonates with violence the
angry people of Paris after centuries of
cruel inequality harsh oppression even
starvation fearful of having their new
movement for reform demolished so soon
decided that it was now or never to take
action screw reform they decided they'd
do one better
how about revolution the people of Paris
believing the French military was
preparing to attack decided they should
armed themselves the National Assembly
announced the creation of a bourgeois
militia the National Guard and
immediately many troops from the French
military defected over to the
revolutionary side in the early hours of
July 14th 1789 a large crowd stormed and
raided the hotel Bay on Valley DeMille
eteri hospital where they were able to
secure a large number of rifles the bad
news was they weren't able to find any
gunpowder for their new weapons the good
news was they knew exactly where to get
some a prison fortress and a symbol of
royalty ranee towering over power
the Bastille mid-morning the crowd
gathered around the Bastille and
demanded that the man in charge
governor de Launay surrendered the
prison and hand over the gunpowder
obviously governor de l'année was like
no way so he stoled for time by inviting
a few members of the crowd in for
negotiations the crowd still waiting
outside quickly became impatient and
before long they stormed the fortress
taking on the French troops inside your
majesty we've received word that the
people have surrounded the Bastille
governor de l'année will hold them off
no need to worry
actually your majesty it appears the
crowd is now headed away from the
Bastille you see what did I tell you
clearly governor de l'année has defeated
them and has them on the run no need to
worry uh Your Majesty isn't that
governor delauneys head on a pike well
clearly governor de l'année has taken on
the form of a bodyless pike head Beatty
and the people are so enamored with him
they're parading him around the city no
need to worry at all when the National
Assembly heard about the violence that
had taken place they had two options
either one they denounce it and try to
carry on the revolution using peaceful
means or two they say damn you stuck his
head on a pike that's pretty hardcore
and we love it incidentally they went
with option number two some historians
believe this reaction paved the way for
the utter violence and bloodshed that
would become the legacy of the French
Revolution this widespread acceptance of
violence during the Revolution is also
largely credited to the writings of a
certain genre Marat a man of science
with a horrible skin condition that kept
him confined to a bathtub he began
writing a radical newspaper he
affectionately named the friend of the
people citizens of France be very afraid
given the chance the king and the
nobility won't hesitate to Massacre us
all the solution is simple execute them
kill every last one of them
cut off a thousand heads and if that's
not enough cut off a thousand more oh
hey mr. squeaky what are you doing down
there you're so cute oh I love you too
mr. squeaky mmm now where was I
oh yeah
kill them all it became one of the most
popular publications in Paris during the
revolution and succeeded in spreading
ever increasing fear and anger among the
people in August leaders of the National
Assembly with help from a certain Thomas
Jefferson adopted the Declaration of the
Rights of Man and of the citizen an
incredible document that guaranteed
liberty and equal rights to all men and
when I say men I mean men despite its
glaring shortcomings in gender equality
the massively influential declaration
would go on to inspire the struggle for
liberty and equality across the planet
for centuries however back in France the
vast majority of the people weren't
really so concerned with enlightened
ideas of equality as much as they were
concerned with the fact that they were
still starving bread was still expensive
as hell and hard to come by the people
felt that one reason nothing had been
done yet about the crisis was because
the king simply couldn't see the problem
he lived in Versailles that full 20
kilometers southwest of Paris and as a
result lived in comfort separated from
his dirty stinking subjects on October
5th a crowd of women 7,000 strong
decided they'd do something
unprecedented they decided they'd
removed that separation and confront the
King directly the woman marched all the
way to the king's palace in Versailles
along the way the crowd continued to
grow into the tens of thousands and when
they arrived they demanded an audience
with the king what are those things
outside the palace there poor people
your majesty
that's poor people they say they're
hungry hungry then let them eat cake Wow
see this is the exact BS that led to
this whole mess in the first place
you're so out of touch they're writhing
around in the filth breaking their back
to barely scrape by and they come to you
demanding just the basic ability to feed
themselves and you think a slice of cake
will sort them out well
then let them eat Taco Bell Crunchwrap
supreme wow they're not that desperate
members of the crowd actually managed to
break into the palace with the intention
of killing the queen who narrowly
escaped through a secret passage in her
bedroom the enraged mob killed several
members of the Royal Guard and raised
their heads on pikes which if you
haven't noticed yet is something they
were quite fond of doing the King had no
choice but to come out and talk to the
crowd he agreed to accept his new
position sharing power with the
revolutionary government and to return
to Paris with the crowd removing the
separation between King and subject King
Louie had a problem with people
constantly raiding his palace but one
thing he didn't have a problem with was
people raiding his computer because he
