one of the first questions i remember
asking which is
what else is out there and i would look
out my childhood window at the little
patch of the sky
and i just remember wondering
what they were and what else was out
there and i remember having this feeling
almost of restlessness
[Music]
in 1823 german astronomer heinrich
albers looked up at the nice guy
and saw darkness he wondered
if the universe were infinite and
eternally static then
surely shouldn't the night sky shine
with the light of infinite stars
a dazzling brilliant sky
alba's paradox was so compelling that
many considered it proof
of a finite universe a cosmos that
at some point simply ends
it wasn't until a century later when
edwin hubble observationally established
the reality of an expanding
universe that finally ober's paradox was
firmly solved
you see alba's second assumption was
wrong
the universe is not static
but what does modern astronomy have to
say about the size of the universe
though
is it finite and if so does that mean
there's an
edge or boundary or could it be infinite
an endless ocean of space with
challenging philosophical consequences
if so
join us today as we tackle this question
one of
the grandest of scales
how big is the universe it's the kind of
question that a child might ask when
they first encounter the concept of
space
and yet it is one which continues to
perplex and even
haunt astronomers today it's often said
that astronomy is a
humbling experience for whilst early
thinking considered the
earth the sun the moon to be the de
facto universe
our modern understanding establishes one
which is
unimaginably larger at each stage in
science's
journey of revelation humanity has had
to swallow
another pill of great demotion
being quietly ushered down to an ever
lower seat in the great cosmic hierarchy
these demotions began in the 16th
century when
copernicus kepler and galileo challenged
the geocentric view of their time
revealing that the earth is just another
planet
next in 1838 friedrich bessel pioneered
the parallax method to measure
the distance to 61 cygni a staggering
distance of more than 10
light years or approximately 100
trillion kilometers
skipping ahead to 1920 famed astronomers
harlow shapley and herbert curtis
debated
at the smithsonian museum in natural
history as to whether
distant nebulae were small clouds on the
outside of our own galaxy
or entirely separate galaxies
far further away soon after edwin hubble
established that it was
curtis who was right by proving that
andromeda lay
outside of the milky way galaxy at a
distance of 2.5
million light years and today equipped
with our
fast superior telescopes modern
astronomy has
pushed out our observations to distances
undreamt of to even those pioneering
astronomers
for example look at this image it is
one of the most incredible photos ever
taken
for you are looking at the most distant
galaxy
ever observed gn z11 this
galaxy is so far away that the light
forming this image
left it 13.4 billion
years ago a photographic time machine
the universe itself was just a few
hundred million years old at this time
and so gnz11 is a glimpse at
what the first galaxies to ever formed
must have looked like
if we could see gnz11 as it is now it
would probably be
unrecognizable and in fact likely have
merged with
other galaxies along the way gnz11
is estimated to be 32 billion light
years away now
at first that might seem impossible
because if the light left it
13.4 billion years ago then
surely it should be 13.4 billion
light years away from us the problem
with that logic is that we have fallen
once again into alba's
fallacy because the universe is not
static
in fact gnz11 has been hurtling away
from us
ever since the light from this image
departed or more accurately
i should say that the space between us
has been expanding ever since
and so a correct calculation of gn z11's
current distance
needs to account for this fact and in
doing so
we find that it should be today far more
distant objects like gn11
can just be thought of as establishing a
minimum
size to the universe but remember it's
13.4 billion years old and we know the
universe
is 13.8 billion years old so
surely it should be possible to image an
object that's
even older than gn711 and thus even
further away
and that in turn would extend the
minimum size of the universe yet further
it's at this point that it's useful to
distinguish between two
distinct concepts we have the observable
universe
and the visible universe now neither of
these really have anything to do with
telescope capabilities
rather they are true limits dictated by
space-time itself
the observable universe encompasses a
distance out to a
hypothetical object that was present at
the very
dawn of the universe the big bang but
whose light
is only now just reaching us
of course the universe didn't have any
galaxies or even
stars at the beginning so there are no
objects to detect
nevertheless based on the expansion rate
of the universe
as measured using telescopes like eza's
planck mission
we can estimate that this distance
should be as staggering
45 billion light years away now there
may very well be
something which lies beyond this
hypothetical object but
it's so far away from us that the light
from it has not had enough
time yet to reach us given the age of
the universe
we say that such objects lie beyond our
horizon
much like how a ship beyond the ocean's
horizon
is invisible to us now it's worth
highlighting here that the horizon of
the observable universe
has a special name the particle horizon
everything in the observable universe
must lie within that boundary
now the visible universe is certainly
different from this
in the first few hundred thousand years
after the big bang
the universe was incredibly hot so much
so that it was
filled with an ionized plasma which
essentially acted
like a thick fog light couldn't traverse
the cosmos without interacting with this
plasma
and so the bulk of the universe wasn't
transparent
it was opaque it was only when the
universe cooled enough for atoms to form
the fog cleared away in an epoch known
as recombination
finally allowing light to travel freely
so because of this the visible universe
is a little bit smaller than the
observable one but
still one incredibly large the
observable universe
is mind-bogglingly big no
words or analogies can really do justice
to just how
preposterously frankly unreasonably
large it is when trying to imagine the
enormity
of it one has a sense that our or
only skirts the very fringes of its true
wonder and that if we ever did
comprehend its volume we might
never come back like falling from a
great height
yet we are compelled to ask
could it be even bigger take the
observable universe
correspond to a distance 45 billion
light years away now usually at this
point
videos like this take that number and
double it so
90 billion light years and they would
call that the diameter of the observable
universe
we have to be a little bit careful about
that though because what if one day we
discover another
gn z11 galaxy in the opposite direction
to where we found the first and
i don't just mean a galaxy which is
similar to gnz11
i mean a galaxy which is identical well
that would imply that the universe
somehow
wraps around on itself kind of like
walking the surface of the spherical
earth
and so the non-repeating plane of the
universe what we might call the
fundamental plane
would have to be necessarily smaller
than this 90 billion light-year number
so do we actually see
any evidence for this well let's return
to the moment of recombination in the
early universe
this is the oldest most ancient light
that we can observe
and it comes from all directions after
all
the entire universe was filled with this
ionized plasma
this light is known as the cosmic
microwave background
or cmb and it encodes the temperature of
the universe
at this time any patch of the cmb
more than two degrees away from another
patch is simply too far away to have had
time for
light to have traveled between them at
least given the age of the universe at
the time just
380 000 years old so if we see
a particular pattern or ripple repeated
in the cmb
that is separated by more than two
degrees well that implies that space
somehow wraps around on itself and that
in turn means that the universe might be
smaller than we initially thought
detailed studies of the cnb reveal no
search repeating structures though
and this lack of structure can actually
be used to put
lower limits on the size of the full
unobservable universe but
not surprisingly these limits
essentially correspond to the
approximate size of the
observable universe 90 billion light
years
another way that we might try to
determine the size of the universe
is through a logical argument suppose
that somebody lives
in the distant galaxy gnz11
they will be able to look towards us and
see
the faint young milky way as it is in
the process of forming but
they could also look the other direction
where they see
a boundary to the edge of the universe a
physical edge
whilst we cannot truly know what they
might see
a basic assumption in astronomy is the
so-called cosmological principle
it's really an extension of the
copernican principle
which states that we do not live in a
special part of the universe
so what we see around us in the local
universe is typical
and thus by extension what the
inhabitants of gnz11 see around them
in their part of the universe is likely
not that different from us at least on
the
largest of scales now this cosmological
principle doesn't rigorously prove
anything about the size of the universe
it merely poses a logical premise
by the cosmological principle
inhabitants of the edge of our
observable universe
should themselves be able to see another
entire observable universe around them
and naively
we should be able to rinse wash repeat
and just keep using this argument to
fill out
an infinite universe but again we have
to be careful in this thinking because
of the possibility that space
might be curved consider in this
direction
at the edge of our observable universe
we have alice
alice looks out in that same direction
and can see the very edge of
her observable universe someone else
let's call him
carlos okay so now let's go back to the
earth
and look in the opposite direction over
on the particle horizon we again have
another person and
we can tell that it isn't alice let's
call them bob
as before bob looks out in the same
direction and
he too can see someone else just like
alice did however it turns out that bob
is in fact looking at carlos again to
any
individual observer there is no
repetition but
alice and bob are in fact both able to
see the same
person carlos and since alice and bob
live
far beyond each other's particle
horizons there's no
way they can communicate this
information to each other and of course
we can equally play this game in
other directions too in this scenario
then
no one is able to actually tell that the
universe repeats and thus
therefore would be finite and compact in
size
so really we can't use the cosmological
principle to argue for a much larger
size to the universe
or we can really say is it within the
observable universe we don't see in
repeating patterns
and thus as far as we can tell the
universe appears to be
90 billion light years in extent as a
minimum
repeating patterns are not the only way
to place limits on size though
already i've mentioned the concept of
curvature and so
here perhaps we might finally have a
clue unto its true size
standing on the earth we can't directly
see its curvature because
the radius of curvature is just so vast
that it's imperceptible
but the curvature of the earth can be
detected with some geometry
as was famously done so by eratosthenes
two
millennia ago simply by comparing the
lengths of shadows of sticks
in the midday sun at two different
locations
in an analogous way astronomers can use
the cnb radiation
and some geometry to measure the
curvature of the universe itself
a simple way to think about this is that
on a positively curved surface
like say a sphere two initially parallel
lines can eventually meet
for example if we both head straight
north no matter
where you live or i live we will
eventually bump into each other at the
north pole
in contrast on a flat surface the lines
stay true and parallel forever
and on a negatively curved surface like
a saddle
they actually diverge so how curved
is the universe this curvature parameter
known as omega k has been measured to
ever greater position thanks to an array
of missions studying the c
and b radiation from the primordial
universe
the earliest scientific estimate done by
the boomerang experiment
in 2000 found that it was roughly flat
with
an error of six percent thirteen years
later
nasa's wmap mission constrained it to be
even flatter
now with an error of just point four
percent
and most recently esa's planck mission
published our most precise estimate to
date which
is again flat now within point one
nine percent i think it's worth pausing
here just to appreciate the amazing
technical feat by
legions of astronomers involved that we
can measure the curvature
of space itself to this level of
precision but what do these results
really mean well consider that this
curvature parameter
is indeed exactly zero a perfectly flat
universe now it's at this point that
many would interpret that flatness to
imply
that the universe therefore must be
infinite
if space-time really is perfectly flat
then with the most simplistic
application of einstein's equations we
get that the universe is
infinite data from the wmap as well as
planck spacecraft however
indicates that the universe is flat or
nearly flat
with an error of about 0.4
a flat universe would be an infinite
universe look it's perfectly reasonable
to say that an infinite universe is a
possible explanation to this zero
curvature
but it's not the only explanation in
fact it would be a non-sequitur to say
that this flatness demands or requires
an infinite universe
to cosmologists flatness doesn't really
mean what we might naively think in a
familiar day-to-day sense of the word a
flat
universe doesn't have to be infinite in
fact we've already discussed an example
of such a universe
now let's go back to our friends alice
bob
and carlos and imagine that the universe
really is
a flat two-dimensional sheet as depicted
here
now if we had a warp drive ship and
definitely not a usb
charger we could leave from the earth
head towards alice
and when we reach carlos we would
actually re-emerge
on the other side and now be heading
back home again
this is probably familiar to many
computer gamers since games like pac-man
and snake
often feature this very rule so what
this means is that the left side
and the right side really represent the
same
boundary and the universe can be seen to
wrap around itself at that point
now if the up and down directions just
go on forever then
another way we can visualize this
pac-man-esque rule
is to fold this up and make a cylinder
in fact technically since i made this
from a two-dimensional sheet
this is really what we would call a
two-cylinder now this two-cylinder
is really defined by this wrap-around
edge pac-man-esque rule that
operates on the original 2d sheet
what is known as the fundamental domain
it is that rule and really that rule
alone that makes it
a two cylinder now when we roll this
thing up what we're really doing
is embedding this two cylinder into
three-dimensional space but really
that's just us
choosing to visualize it that way yes
when it's embedded it has
curvature but that's purely a product of
the embedding
it's actually still a flat geometry
in its fundamental domain now as
intriguing as this topology is it
doesn't really save us from an infinite
universe because of course the top
and the bottom extend out to infinity so
let's go back to the fundamental domain
and
look at these rules one more time what
if we had another rule
that going past this lower edge takes
you
back up to the top in fact we can
represent that
with these two blue
lines and when we do that we now truly
have
full snake rules now a fundamental
domain that is described by these
two rules is no longer an infinite
two-cylinder
but rather a finite to taurus
now we call it a taurus because if i
imagine re-embedding this domain in
three dimensions
i'd first connect the two red ends which
would form a cylinder
as before but now i have to connect the
two blue ends together
in practice i can't really do that
without distorting the plane but
we can imagine that it should form
something like a taurus
now at this point it's useful to discuss
the work of the mathematician
john nash who you probably know from the
biography and film
a beautiful mind the fact that you have
to stretch and distort the fundamental
plane in order to create this
taurus shape means that you failed to
isometrically embed it
and that isometric part is key because
when we look around the universe we
don't see
distances distorted in this way but john
nash proved that
it was in fact possible to isometrically
embed this
to taurus into three dimensions how
well by adding waves and waves of tiny
corrugations
during this embedding procedure this was
a beautiful proof
but it didn't actually reveal what this
to taurus embedded into 3d
would actually look like in 2012 a
french team used supercomputers to
finally calculate
what this shape would look like this
stunning morphology
is in fact flat in the fundamental
domain and it adheres to the two taurus
pacman star rules
it's a mind-bending topology riddled
with
infinite layers of ever smaller
corrugations forming this
baffling taurus one of strange beauty
and fascination
and what's truly mind-blowing is that we
may
very well be looking at the topology of
our universe
a finite flat cosmos embedded in some
higher dimensional space
of course remember that this is a
tutorial it's made of a two-dimensional
plane
since our universe has three spatial
dimensions then
the universe would need to be a three
taurus so
a kind of hyperdimensional extension of
this incredible shape
indeed the three taurus was formally
proposed as a possible shape of the
universe by
astrophysicists starabinsky and
zeldovich
back in 1984. the three taurus is in
fact just one of
ten possible manaforts which could
represent a flat finite
universe six of these are known as
orientable
and include the three taurus but the
other four
are known as non-orientable manifolds
and include
this thing the bizarre pline bottle
a mind-bending shape of technically zero
embedded volume this orientability
property
is best understood by looking at a
simpler manifold
the mobius strip bizarrely if you travel
along the mobius
after one circuit your left and your
right
have switched over you've become a
mirror version of yourself
if our universe is truly one of these
non-orientable manifolds
it would have some bizarre consequences
for a hypothetical warpship
leave the earth and travel in one
direction long enough and you would
return
home arriving back on the earth you
would at first feel the familiarity and
relief
of being back on your home planet but
you would quickly realize that something
was off your family's faces would be
strangely unfamiliar as mirror versions
of their previous selves
looking down at their wrists you might
notice that their watches
ticked anticlockwise but from their
perspective
it would be you who was changed and
taking you to the doctor for a medical
examination
they discovered that your heart was now
on the right hand side
for all intents and purposes you would
have become
an alien remarkably all ten of these
manifolds are perfectly consistent with
their observations of the universe and
all 10 are finite so any of them
could be true but there is another
possibility that the universe could be
infinite and that could mean either an
infinite flat domain going out in all
directions
or perhaps even an infinite negatively
curved saddle-shaped universe either way
we are forced to face an ontological
crisis
what if the universe is infinite
infinities are uncomfortable to
physicists because
they bring along some disturbing
consequences
given infinite possibilities everything
that can happen
must happen not just once but an
infinite number of times in seeking a
way out of this one might consider that
sure perhaps space is indeed infinite
but
at some point the nature of the universe
itself
radically changes and we could say that
in effect
there is an end to the universe indeed
there is some theoretical work which at
first seems to fit the bill here
in the so-called eternal inflation model
our local universe is
really a bubble-like region where the
hyper-expansion phase
known as inflation simply subdued but
if you traveled far enough you would
enter a region where the inflationary
field has a different state
expanding space so much that each bubble
universe is separated by
unimaginable distances however since the
entire
landscape is still infinite there would
be an
infinite number of these bubble
universes so
in truth this doesn't really solve our
dilemma so let's just stop
evading and finally face the possibility
head on an infinite cosmos
infinities disrupt probability theory
because all events
will occur an infinite number of times
like
infinite number of monkeys typing on
infinite typewriters
in some ways the idea challenges the
cosmological principle because now
we're surrounded by an infinite number
of radically different cosmologies
as well as an infinite number of
identical ones
at a human level an infinite universe
raises some
unsettling consequences because it would
mean that there is an
infinite number of u's out there
not just similar to use but used with
the
exact same arrangement of molecules and
atoms right down to the quantum states
of your subatomic particles that
immediately provides a kind of
way out of the famous no cloning theorem
that's a quantum theory proved by james
park that states that
it's impossible to ever create an
independent and identical copy of an
arbitrary quantum state
in other words it shouldn't be possible
to produce an exact
duplicate of you and that's
philosophically convenient because
if such a clone existed that shared
every single quantum state to you
then surely that is you but in the case
of an infinite universe
its very nature disrupts this
ontological convenience
going further some of these
doppelgangers would sit inside an entire
solar system galaxy even
universe that was identical to that of
our own
right down to the last atom
each one would be watching this video
right now their jaw dropping their
sense of self-dissolving as they
challenge
the very meaning of who and what
they are yet more in the past and in the
future
there are infinite dopplegangers of you
slightly offset in time
a version of you one day behind or two
weeks ahead
or maybe even separated by eons
you are everywhere and you
never end as disconcerting
and unsettling as this seems it perhaps
provides some
relief in other ways so it means that
our close loved ones that we've lost
continue to live
somewhere both offset in space-time but
also through different choices it would
mean there was an infinite number
of loved doppelgangers who didn't get in
the car that day
who decided not to take those terrible
drugs
or who got to the hospital in time
still out there somewhere
just unimaginably distant
at the same time an infinite universe
can also
paradoxically feel empty even
nihilistic for many we define our goals
in life
in terms of our impact on the world
around us but
that impact dissolves away in infinity
for example if your mission is to reduce
suffering amongst humanity
it is challenged by the fact that in an
infinite universe
there is infinite human suffering
whatever you
do whatever you subtract from that
infinity
it's still infinite in fact
surely anything we do is futile when
faced with the
sheer cliff the abyss of infinity
as we look further and further out let
us finally turn back
to inner space we can't affect
an infinite universe or realistically
the infinitely smaller one that we see
around us
rather than trying to derive meaning
from our impact on a
cosmic scale the ensemble of space
perhaps meaning lies closer to home
because whilst there might be an
infinite number of views out there
only you can control your actions today
how you choose to live your life how you
treat
others and so even the smallest acts of
kindness
can carry infinite weight so
until the next video stay thoughtful
and stay curious
[Music]
your life is your life
don't let it be globbed into dank
submission
beyond the watch there are ways out
there is a light somewhere it may not be
much light but it beats the dark nurses
you
